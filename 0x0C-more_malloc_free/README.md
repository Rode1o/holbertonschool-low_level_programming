# README

Welcome. This is the 0x0C-more_malloc_free directory where I'm storing more exercises showing the usage of dynamic memory allocation with `malloc` and `free`. Here are the files and its descriptions:

 - holberton.h: Header file for all tasks.
 - _putchar.c: Holberton's putchar version.
 - 0-malloc_checked.c: Function that allocates memory. If the allocation failed, exit with code 98. 
 - 1-string_nconcat.c: Function that concatenates the first string with the first `n` bytes of the second string.
 - 2-calloc.c: Function that allocates memory and initializes with zeroes.
 - 3-array_range.c: Function that creates an array of integers from `min` to `max`.
