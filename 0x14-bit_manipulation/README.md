# README

Welcome. This is the 0x14-bit_manipulation directory where I'm storing exercises showing the usage of bitwise operators. Here are the files and its descriptions:

 - holberton.h: Header file with the function prototypes of this project.
 - *-main.c: Main files for testing the project's functions.
 - 0-binary_to_uint.c: Function that converts a binary number to unsigned int.
 - 1-print_binary.c: Function that converts an unsigned int to binary.
 - 2-get_bit.c: Function that returns the bit of a number's representation in binary given an index.
 - 3-set_bit.c: Function that sets a bit to 1 of a number's representation in binary given an index.
 - 4-clear_bit.c: Function that clears a bit of a number's representation in binary given an index.
 - 5-flip_bits.c: Function that counts how many bits are needed to be flipped to convert a number to another.
