# README

Welcome. This is the 0x0D-preprocessor directory where I'm storing exercises showing the usage of macros function-like macros. Here are the files and its descriptions:

 -  0-object_like_macro.h: Header file with a macro named `SIZE` with the token 1024.
 - *-main.c: Main files for testing the project's macros.
 - 1-pi.h: Header file with a macro named `PI` with the token 3.14159265359.
 - 2-main.c: Program that prints the source code file name.
 - 3-function_like_macro.h: Header file with a function-like macro that computes the absolute value of the number `x`.
 - 4-sum.h: Header file with a function-like macro that computes the sum of numbers `x` and `y`.
