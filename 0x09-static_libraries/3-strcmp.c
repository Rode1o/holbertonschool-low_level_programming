 * *_strcmp - compares two strings outputing an integer.
 *
 * Description: compares two strings, and its output, being an integer,
 *              shows the difference in ASCII between characters in s1
 *              and s2. If 0, then both strings are equal. If positive,
 *              then the character being compared from s1 is greater than s2,
 *              negative if otherwise.
 * @s1: the source string.
 * @s2: the string it will be compared to.
 *
 * Return: an integer.
