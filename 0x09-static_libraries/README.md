# README

Welcome. This is the 0x09-static_libraries directory where I'm storing exercises showing the usage and creation of static libraries. Here are the files and its descriptions:

 - holberton.h: Header file with all function prototypes.
 - create_static_lib.sh: Shell script to create a static library from all `.c` files (functions) to be used in future programs. 
 - libholberton.a: Static library with a selection of compiled `.c` files functions.
 - c_functions/: Folder with the selected .c functions to create the `libholberton.a` static library.
 - main.c: Program for testing the `libholberton.a` static library.
