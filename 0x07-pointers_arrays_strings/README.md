 - 0-memset.c: Function that fills memory with a constant byte.
 - 1-memcpy.c: Function that copies memory area.
 - 2-strchr.c: Function that locates a character in a string.
 - 3-strspn.c: in progress...
 - 4-strpbrk.c: in progress...
 - 5-strstr.c: in progress...
 - 7-print_chessboard.c: Function that prints a chessboard configuration.
 - 8-print_diagsums.c: Function that prints the sums of the two diagonals of a matrix of integers.
