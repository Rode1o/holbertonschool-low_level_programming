# README

Welcome. This is the 0x0E-structures_typedef directory where I'm storing exercises showing the usage of structures (`structs`) and the keyword `typedef`. Here are the files and its descriptions:

 - dogs.h: Header file with the struct definition of `dog` and the function prototypes of this project.
 - *-main.c: Main files for testing the project's struct and functions.
 - 1-init_dog.c: Function that initializes a variable of type `struct dog`.
 - 2-print_dog.c: Function that prints a `struct dog`.
 - 4-new_dog.c: Function that creates a new dog.
 - 5-free_dog.c: Function that frees the memory allocated to a `struct dog`.
