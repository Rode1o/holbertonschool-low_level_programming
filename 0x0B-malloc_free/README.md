# README

Welcome. This is the 0x0B-malloc_free directory where I'm storing exercises showing the usage of dynamic memory allocation with `malloc` and `free`. Here are the files and its descriptions:

 - holberton.h: Header file for all tasks.
 - _putchar.c: Holberton's putchar version.
 - 0-create_array.c: Function that creates an array of chars and initializes it with a specific char.
 - 1-strdup.c: Function that returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of the string str.
 - 2-str_concat.c: Function that concatenates two strings.
 - 3-alloc_grid.c: Function that returns a pointer to a matrix of integers.
 - 4-free_grid.c: Function that frees the memory allocated to the previous matrix created.
 - 5-argstostr.c: Function that concatenates all the arguments of a program to a string.
 - 100-strtow.c: Function that splits a string into words null-terminated.
