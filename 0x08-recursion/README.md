# README

Welcome. This is the 0x08-recursion directory where I'm storing exercises showing the usage ofthe recursion concept. Here are the files and its descriptions:

 - holberton.h: Header file for all tasks.
 - _putchar.c: Holberton's putchar version.
 - *-main.c: The diverse main files for testing the functions.
 - 0-puts_recursion.c: Function that prints a string recursively, followed by a new line.
 - 1-print_rev_recursion.c: Function that prints a string recursively in reverse.
 - 2-strlen_recursion.c: Function that prints the length of a string recursively.
 - 3-factorial.c: Function that prints the factorial of a number recursively.
 - 4-pow_recursion.c: Function that prints the power of a number recursively.
 - 5-sqrt_recursion.c: Function that prints the square root of a number recursively.
 - 6-is_prime_number.c: Function that prints whether a number is prime or not. 
 - 7-is_palindrome.c: Function that prints whether a string is palindromic or not.
