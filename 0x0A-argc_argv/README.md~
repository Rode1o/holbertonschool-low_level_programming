# README

Welcome. This is the 0x0A-argc_argv directory where I'm storing exercises showing the usage of argument vectors within the main function (`argv`), and its length (`argc`). Here are the files and its descriptions:

 - holberton.h: Header file for all tasks.
 - _putchar.c: Holberton's putchar version.
 - 0-whatsmyname.c: program that prints its name.
 - 1-args.c: program that prints the number of arguments passed to it.
 - 2-args.c: program that all arguments received.
 - 3-mul.c: program that multiplies two numbers.
 - 4-add.c: program that adds positive numbers.
